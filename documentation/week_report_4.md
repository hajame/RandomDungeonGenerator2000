# Week 3

- [Hour reporting](https://github.com/hajame/RandomDungeonGenerator2000/blob/master/documentation/hour_report.md)

## Progress during week 4

- Writing lots of JUnit tests
- Generator fills missed areas with mazes.
- Connecting Mazes and Rooms

## Class updates

### Generator

## Problems

- Some times rooms would return empty doorSegment lists. -> Null Exception. Fixed this using a check. Rooms may in rare cases end up without a door.
- Realized a little too late that I need to finish up some documentation.

## Lessons learned

Coding doesn't require a lot of time, you just need to use your time effectively.

## Next week

- Delete dead ends (todo)
- Replace some of the data structures.
- Optimize algorithm.
