## Progress during weeks 7-8

- Addressing issues from excellent feedback from my colleagues
- Documentation
  - Test result visualization and description
  - UML class diagram
  - User's guide
- Terminal arguments and creating a jar file

## Class updates

### Main
- Has terminal arguments

## Lessons learned
- Writing JUnit tests early on pays off.
- Estimating time complexities turns out to be more difficult than I expected.

## Not enough time to address these problems
- Ensuring all Mazes and Rooms are connected
- UTF-8 text not displaying on all systems
