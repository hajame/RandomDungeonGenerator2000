# Week 7-8 (final report)

- [Hour reporting](https://github.com/hajame/RandomDungeonGenerator2000/blob/master/documentation/hour_report.md)

## Progress during weeks 7-8
- More JUnit tests that cover individual methods instead of integration testing
- Addressing issues from excellent feedback from my colleagues
- Documentation
- Terminal arguments and creating jar file

## Class updates

### Main
- Has terminal arguments

## Lessons learned
- Writing JUnit tests early on pays off.

## Not enough time for these problems
- Connecting Mazes and Rooms (Might never happen, depending on time constraints)
- UTF-8 text not displaying on all systems
