# Week 1

- [Hour reporting](https://github.com/hajame/RandomDungeonGenerator2000/blob/master/documentation/hour_reporting.md)

## Progress during week 1

- Deciding on a topic
- Project creation
- Project specifications and readme
- Project base structure

## Problems

Most of the time spent this week was on deciding the topic. I took a long time juggling ideas, what can be completed in this 7-week time. I chose the random dungeon generator because it is a nice and simple idea, and also because the focus of this coursework is in creating problem-solving algorithms and custom data structures.  

This, along with the documentation, took long, so I haven't started coding yet.

## Lessons learned

Try to avoid dwelling on too long on a single topic. Try to make your analysis of the difficulty of the problem quick and systematic.

## Next week

An algorithm that creates random rooms and (hopefully) fills the rest of the space with mazes.
