# Week 2

- [Hour reporting](https://github.com/hajame/RandomDungeonGenerator2000/blob/master/documentation/hour_report.md)

## Progress during week 2

__Started coding!__  

- Designed some of the classes
- Created:
	- Dungeon
	- Room
	- Position
- Created tests for DungeonTest
	- canBePlaced method testing

### Dungeon class

- init() creates walls on the perimeter of the map
- canBePlaced(room) checks if the given room overlaps with map walls or other rooms.

## Problems

Couldn't decide if I need an ArrayList or not. Decided to create it now and decide later if I'm going to ditch it.

## Lessons learned


## Next week

An algorithm that creates random rooms and (hopefully) fills the rest of the space with mazes.
