# Week 6

- [Hour reporting](https://github.com/hajame/RandomDungeonGenerator2000/blob/master/documentation/hour_report.md)

## Progress during week 6
- JUnit tests
- Empirical testing
- Custom ArrayList: HarrayList
  - Fixed previous performance issues
- Documentation

## Class updates

### Main
- Uses HarrayList instead of ArrayList

### PositionList
- Uses HarrayList instead of LinkedList
  
## Successes
- Created a working ArrayList that fixed the performance issues of last week.

## Problems
- UTF-8 text not displaying on all systems.

## Lessons learned
- Writing your own datastructures is not hard, you just need to use the right one for the job!

## Next week
- Connecting Mazes and Rooms (Might never happen, depending on time constraints)
- Optimizing datastructures for increased speed
- More JUnit tests that cover individual methods instead of integration testing.
